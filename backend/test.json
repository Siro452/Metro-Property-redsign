Private from the street, this delightfully renovated 3 bedroom home is a surprise in all the best ways, with a nostalgic 'beach cottage' character that is apparent throughout.

With a beautiful, quality new laundry and bathroom, plus plans available for an ensuite to the master bedroom, all 3 bedrooms are of a good size & have in-wall and ceiling insulation to keep you warm, plus this home is mostly double-glazed. The living area flows out to a deck & the private rear garden- great for entertaining, where there is room for children & pets to play, plus a workshop for keen gardeners & handymen to tinker. Situated in a family-friendly street, just a short walk from the beach, village school & shops, this sunny home also offers a single carport.",
